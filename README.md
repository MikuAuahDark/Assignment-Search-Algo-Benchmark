Searching Algo
=====

Various searching algorithms for my assignment. Includes:

* Breadth-first Search

* Depth-first Search

* Depth-limited Search

* Uniform Cost Search

* Iterative Deepening Depth-first Search

* Bi-directional Search

Some Lua scripts are used to generate the graph code.

* case 3 is generated with `case3build.lua`, the data is `case_3.txt`, the image is `case3.jpg`

* star system graph is generated with `main.lua` (requires LOVE), the data is `stars.csv`, and the image is `test_graph_stars.png`

And `build_statistic.lua` is used to generate the resulting data from the redirected stderr of `main.cpp`.
